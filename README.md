# Data Visualization: Wizkid Lagos to Global Stardom

The WIZKID.pdf is a poster I made of Ayodeji Balogun popularly known as Wizkid. I analyzed the audio features of Wizkid’s songs alongside his music streams. The aim was to explore his evolution as an artist from a music star in Nigeria to his emergence on the global stage and see how his music has evolved over the years. 

The audio features were gotten from Spotify’s developer API while I web-scrapped his album streams and listens from Spotify using Python and saved to a CSV. To extract the song lyrics for the wordcloud, I set up a custom google search engine and preprocessed the text with Python. The analysis and visualizations were done using Tableau.
