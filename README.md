# Data Visualization: Wizkid Lagos to Global Stardom

For this project, I analyzed the audio features of songs and Spotify streams of Ayodeji Balogun popularly known as Wizkid, and created a poster. The aim of this project was to explore his evolution as an artist from a music star in Lagos, Nigeria to his emergence on the global stage and see how his music has evolved over the years. 

The audio features were extracted from Spotifyâ€™s developer API while I web-scrapped his album streams and listens from Spotify using Python. To extract the song lyrics for the Wordcloud, I set up a custom Google search engine and preprocessed the text with Python. The analysis and visualizations were done using Tableau.
